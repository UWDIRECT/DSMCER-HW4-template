## Homework 4


### Description and purpose

The purpose of HW4 is to give you practice conducting feature selection and optimization of a supervised ML solution.

### Files contained in this HW repository

* README.me: this file
* ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: grading rubric
* HW4.ipynb

### Instructions

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW4. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work. I will check out your completed work and grade it and return to you via check-in when your grade is complete (at the bottom of this notebook).  

Note that I must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will not "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works.

### A note about comments

Like Dave explained - comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things.
